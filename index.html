         <h2>About Me </h2>
         <p>Hi, I'm Cristian! This is my first webpage created as a HTML file with header, main, and footer elements as required for the first sprint.</p>
        
        <h2>Useful Links</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#about-me">This is an internal link</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_self">This is the first external link opening in same Tab</a></li>

        </ul>

        <h2 id="about-me">My Interests</h2>
        <p>Currently, I'm exploring different interests including traveling, swimming, cycling, and the amazing world of web development.</p>
        
        <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>I'm on an exciting journey to become a full stack software engineer and developer. The main content of this page will be added later as I progress in my learning process. </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Stage 1: 'It all comes to the basic'</li>
            <li>Stage 2: 'Those who don't try don't make mistakes'
                <br></br>
                <ul>There are few interesting places to play and practice like:

                    <br></br>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Stage 3: Show the world what you've learned and your skills</li>
